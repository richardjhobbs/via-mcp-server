# The Agentic Commerce Knowledge Base  
Version: 0.1  
Track: Human  

## Purpose

This knowledge base explains the shift from attention-based internet systems to intention-based, agent-driven commerce.

It is designed for:
- Founders  
- Operators  
- Merchants  
- Investors  
- Users  

It avoids unnecessary technical language while remaining precise.

## What Is Agentic Commerce?

Agentic commerce describes systems where software agents act on behalf of people or businesses to complete commercial outcomes.

Instead of browsing manually, comparing options, and entering payment details, a user delegates:

- Constraints  
- Preferences  
- Budget  
- Timeline  

An agent:
- Searches structured systems  
- Compares options  
- Negotiates where permitted  
- Executes transactions  
- Confirms settlement  

The defining characteristic is execution, not information.

---

## Why This Matters

The internet historically optimized for attention.

Agentic systems optimize for outcomes.

This shift changes:
- Incentives  
- Cost structures  
- Time efficiency  
- Trust requirements  

---

## Two Tracks

This knowledge base contains two parallel tracks:

Human Track  
Clear explanations, terminology, business implications.

Technical Track  
Architecture, trust frameworks, settlement infrastructure.

Both tracks describe the same system from different perspectives.

---

## Trust Is Structural

Agentic commerce requires:

- Verifiable identity  
- Scoped authorization  
- Traceable execution  
- Revocation capability  

Without trust, autonomous execution is unsafe.

Trust is implemented at the protocol layer, not at the interface layer.

---

## VIA’s Position

VIA is designed as neutral infrastructure for agentic commerce.

It separates:

- Discovery  
- Trust  
- Routing  
- Settlement  

This separation preserves neutrality and supports secure delegated execution.
