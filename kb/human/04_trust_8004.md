# Why Trust Matters in Agentic Commerce

## The Core Question

If software is going to:
- Negotiate
- Execute payments
- Manage subscriptions
- Route transactions

How do you know the other system is legitimate?

---

## Traditional Trust

Historically, trust came from:

- Brand reputation  
- Payment networks  
- Platform mediation  

Agentic commerce changes this.

Machines interact with machines.

Trust must move into the protocol layer.

## What Agent Trust Means

Agent trust requires:

1. Verifiable identity  
2. Defined authorization scope  
3. Cryptographic execution validation  
4. Revocation capability  
5. Traceable transaction logs  

Without these, systems are vulnerable to impersonation or misrouting.

## 8004 and Structured Verification

Within VIA’s model, agent identity and authorization align with a structured verification framework based on 8004 principles.

This provides:

- Deterministic identity anchoring  
- Scoped delegated authority  
- Signature validation  
- Auditable execution trails  

Users do not see this layer.

But it protects:

- Payment integrity  
- Authorization limits  
- Transaction authenticity

## Why LLM Search Is Not Enough

An LLM can recommend a product.

It cannot securely execute across multiple independent systems without:

- Verified identity  
- Structured authorization  
- Secure settlement integration  

Agentic commerce requires trust infrastructure.
