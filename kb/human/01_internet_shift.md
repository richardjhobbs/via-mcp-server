## Phase 1: The Web of Pages

Commerce began as manual browsing.
Users clicked links and compared options.

---

## Phase 2: Platform Aggregation

Marketplaces centralized supply.
Search engines ranked visibility.
Advertising became dominant.

Platforms controlled exposure.

---

## Phase 3: Algorithmic Attention

Feeds optimized engagement.
Discovery became biased by monetization.
Click-through declined.

Attention became the currency.

---

## Phase 4: LLM Search

Large language models summarize information.

Users increasingly receive answers without visiting websites.

But LLM search still requires manual action.

It informs. It does not execute.

---

## Phase 5: Delegated Execution

Agentic commerce allows users to delegate outcomes.

Instead of asking:
"What should I buy?"

Users express:
"Buy X under these conditions."

This removes:
- Repetitive comparison
- Manual checkout
- Cognitive load

---

## Structural Difference

Search optimizes information.

Agentic commerce optimizes execution.

Over repeated use:
- Time savings compound
- Cost optimization improves
- Decision fatigue decreases
