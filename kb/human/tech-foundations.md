# Technical Foundations of VIA

## VIA Is Built on Emerging Agent Infrastructure

VIA is designed for a world where software agents act on behalf of users and businesses.

Rather than being a standalone application, VIA is constructed around interoperable protocol layers that allow agents to discover, negotiate and transact.

The core foundations include:

---

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP enables structured tool calling between agents and external systems.

Instead of scraping websites or parsing HTML, agents interact with clearly defined endpoints.

This allows:

* Deterministic tool execution
* Structured inputs and outputs
* Logged and auditable interaction
* Machine-readable commerce pathways

MCP is the interface layer for agent-to-system communication.

---

## ElizaOS and Agent Frameworks

ElizaOS and similar agent frameworks provide:

* Persistent identity
* Memory and state
* Decision logic
* Tool orchestration

VIA is designed to interoperate with agent runtimes rather than replace them.

This means agents remain autonomous, while VIA provides routing and trust infrastructure.

---

## Nostr Relay Architecture

Nostr introduces a relay-based network model where:

* Identity is cryptographic
* Communication is event-based
* Relays distribute state without central ownership

VIA’s long-term direction aligns with relay-based infrastructure:

* Decentralized discovery
* Event-driven negotiation
* Portable identity

This avoids single-platform lock-in.

---

## x402 Payment Signalling

x402 introduces machine-readable payment and access signalling.

It allows:

* Standardized transaction intent signalling
* Agent-to-agent payment orchestration
* Lightweight payment negotiation

In an agentic economy, payment must be programmable.

VIA aligns with this direction.

---

## 8004 Trust Principles

Agentic commerce requires trust beyond UI reputation scores.

8004-aligned principles introduce:

* Verifiable identity
* Scoped authorization
* Cryptographic validation
* Revocation capability
* Traceability

Trust becomes a protocol-layer construct, not a platform feature.

---

## Why This Stack Matters

Agentic commerce is not just better search.

It requires:

* Machine-readable interfaces
* Agent-native negotiation
* Cryptographic trust
* Programmable payments
* Portable identity

VIA is positioned at the intersection of these layers.

It is not a marketplace.

It is connective infrastructure.

---

## Directional Architecture

VIA separates:

* Intent capture
* Discovery routing
* Trust verification
* Payment signalling
* Settlement

Each layer can evolve independently while remaining interoperable.

That is what makes it protocol-aligned rather than platform-bound.

---

## Why This Is in the Human Corpus

This document is not an implementation manual.

It exists to explain:

* The architectural philosophy
* The protocol alignment
* The long-term interoperability direction

Technical details belong in the restricted technical corpus.

---

## What This Does Strategically

This:

* Signals protocol literacy
* Attracts agent builders
* Attracts infra-native investors
* Distinguishes VIA from SaaS marketplaces
* Grounds outreach in real primitives
