Track: Technical  

## Layer 1: Intent

Structured expression of constraints and objectives.

---

## Layer 2: Agent

Reasoning engine interpreting intent.

---

## Layer 3: Protocol

Agent-to-agent or agent-to-merchant communication standards.

---

## Layer 4: Payment

Authorization and transaction execution.

---

## Layer 5: Settlement

Deterministic confirmation of value transfer.

---

## Layer 6: Merchant Systems

Inventory, pricing, availability APIs.

---

## Layer 7: Fulfilment

Delivery confirmation mechanisms.

---

## Trust Boundary

Trust verification must occur:

- Before execution  
- At authorization validation  
- During settlement confirmation  

Without protocol-level trust, execution risk increases significantly.
