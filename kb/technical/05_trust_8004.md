# Agent Trust and 8004 Framework  
ID: T-TRUST-8004  
Version: 0.1  
Track: Technical  

## Problem Statement

Autonomous agent-to-agent transactions introduce:

- Identity spoofing risk  
- Authorization drift  
- Execution replay  
- Settlement misrouting  

Trust must be cryptographically enforced.

---

## Core Components

1. Deterministic Agent Identity  
2. Scoped Authorization Tokens  
3. Signature Verification  
4. Execution Hash Logging  
5. Revocation Mechanism  

---

## 8004 Alignment

The 8004-aligned trust structure provides:

- Protocol-level identity anchoring  
- Delegation scope encoding  
- Transaction signature validation  
- Traceable execution references  

This enables secure machine-to-machine settlement.

---

## Execution Flow Example

User delegates purchase authority.

Agent signs intent.

Merchant verifies signature.

Settlement executes under scoped authority.

Execution hash logged.

Audit trail preserved.
